const kHammerCurl =
    'Name: Hammer Curl.\n\nSteps:\n\n1: Stand up with your torso upright and a dumbbell on each hand being held at arms length. The elbows should be close to the torso.\n2: The palms of the hands should be facing your torso. This will be your starting position.\n3: Now, while holding your upper arm stationary, exhale and curl the weight forward while contracting the biceps. Continue to raise the weight until the biceps are fully contracted and the dumbbell is at shoulder level. Hold the contracted position for a brief moment as you squeeze the biceps.\n4: After the brief pause, inhale and slowly begin the lower the dumbbells back down to the starting position.\n5: Repeat.  \n\nBenefits: The rotation of your hands allows the brachioradialis to contribute more to the upward motion of the curl than traditional curl exercises even though it is smaller than your biceps. Your brachialis is also worked during these curls and provides important stabilization for your arm as it moves.';

const kOverHeadTriceps =
    'Name: Overhead Triceps Extension.\n\nSteps:\n\n1: To begin, stand up with a dumbbell held by both hands. Your feet should be about shoulder width apart from each other. Slowly use both hands to grab the dumbbell and lift it over your head until both arms are fully extended.\n2: The resistance should be resting in the palms of your hands with your thumbs around it. The palm of the hands should be facing up towards the ceiling. This will be your starting position.\n3: Keeping your upper arms close to your head with elbows in and perpendicular to the floor, lower the resistance in a semicircular motion behind your head until your forearms touch your biceps. Tip: The upper arms should remain stationary and only the forearms should move. Breathe in as you perform this step.\n4: Go back to the starting position by using the triceps to raise the dumbbell. Breathe out as you perform this step.\n5: Repeat. \n\nBenefits: The overhead triceps extension achieves a few important objectives. Beyond strengthening all three heads of the triceps (more on that below), it also activates your core, and recruits your shoulder muscles for stability, Braun says. Plus, in the variation depicted in video, the overhead triceps extension works each arm separately, forcing you to confront and correct any muscle imbalances you might have.';

const kBicepCurl =
    'Name: Biceps Curl.\n\nInstructions: Select dumbbells of weight you can lift 10 times with good form. Suggested starting weights are5 pounds or 10 pounds per dumbbell. If you are rehabilitating from an injury or deconditioning, you might start with 2 pounds.\n\nSteps:\n\n1: Hold a dumbbell in each hand at the sides with palms facing in toward the side of the thigh and arms straight down.\n2: Position the feet comfortably about shoulder-width apart. Brace the core muscles to be ready to lift the weight.\n3: Lift one dumbbell toward the shoulder, rotating the arm as it moves up so that the palm with the dumbbell is now facing upward (supine) and the elbow is pointing to the ground with the forearm almost vertical. Keep the elbow in close to the body. Exhale while lifting.\n4: Lower to the side position and perform the same movement with the other arm. Inhale while lowering the weight.\n5: Continue to alternate until the set is complete.\n6: Do 10 curls with each arm for three sets. If this is too much to start with, dont reduce the weight but do five exercises with each arm. \n\nBenefits: Curls work the biceps muscles at the front of the upper arm, and also the muscles of the lower arm-the brachialis, and brachioradialis. You use these muscles anytime you pick something up, which is common throughout daily life. Doing the arm curl, you build strength and learn to use your arm muscles correctly, bracing with your core muscles. The muscle definition and increased strength are often noticeable within a few sessions, which is very gratifying and motivating.';

const kCrossChestExtension =
    'Name: Cross Chest Extensions.\n\nSteps\n\n1: Stand up holding a pair of dumbbells with your hands down at the side and your palms facing your body (a neutral grip). It is the starting position.\n2: Slowly curl the dumbbell of your left arm across the body towards your right shoulder. Touch the upper part of the dumbbell to the shoulder and maintain the contracted position for a second.\n3: Gradually bring the dumbbell down to the initial position and then perform the same movement with the other arm.\n4: Continue doing the exercise until the required number of reps is done for each arm.\n\nBenefits: The cross body hammer curl specifically targets the brachialis of your forearms, which helps in “pushing” your biceps and triceps apart thereby assisting in building thicker arms. It is a shoulder flexion workout that reduces activation of your biceps muscle and therefore, can be used as a warm-up exercise. It creates a balance between the lower and upper parts of your arms.';

const kSingleArmRows =
    'Name: Single Arm Rows.\n\nSteps:\n\n1: Choose a flat bench and place a dumbbell on each side of it.\n2: Place the right leg on top of the end of the bench, bend your torso forward from the waist until your upper body is parallel to the floor, and place your right hand on the other end of the bench for support.\n3: Use the left hand to pick up the dumbbell on the floor and hold the weight while keeping your lower back straight. The palm of the hand should be facing your torso. This will be your starting position.\n4: Pull the resistance straight up to the side of your chest, keeping your upper arm close to your side and keeping the torso stationary. Breathe out as you perform this step.\n5: Lower the resistance straight down to the starting position. Breathe in as you perform this step.\n6: Repeat the movement for the specified amount of repetitions.\n7: Switch sides and repeat again with the other arm. \n\nBenefits: Single Arm rows increases upper body strength, primarily in the back, increases upper body strength in the shoulders, and to a lesser degree, the musculature of the upper arms and forearms, increases core strength in the erectors, scapula stabilizers, and the anterior core, helps in building muscle and fat lose.';

const kButterflies =
    'Name: Butterflies.\n\nSteps:\n\n1: Sit on the machine with your back flat on the pad.\n2: Take hold of the handles. Tip: Your upper arms should be positioned parallel to the floor; adjust the machine accordingly. This will be your starting position.\n3: Push the handles together slowly as you squeeze your chest in the middle. Breathe out during this part of the motion and hold the contraction for a second.\n4: Return back to the starting position slowly as you inhale until your chest muscles are fully stretched.\n5: Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions. \n\nBenefits: The best part about the butterfly chest move is that it gives quick results and flatters your torso at the same time. It will increase your chest size and reduce the flabbiness. Your waist will look slimmer, since the upper body will be completely toned. When you tone up the chest muscles, the bust line will also see significant changes. Your fitness level will increase faster and you will feel stronger.';

const kPalmPress =
    'Name: Palm Press.\n\nSteps:\n\n1: Start by having a dumbbell in each hand with your arm fully extended to the side using a neutral grip. Your feet should be shoulder width apart from each other. Now slowly lift the dumbbells up until you create a 90 degree angle with your arms.\n2: Continue to maintain a neutral grip throughout the entire exercise. Slowly lift the dumbbells up until your arms are fully extended.\n3: While inhaling lower the weights down until your arm is at a 90 degree angle again.\n4: Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions. \n\nBenefits: This exercise works all aspects of the deltoid muscle of the shoulder. While you can do an overhead press with an exercise machine or barbell, dumbbells offer some unique benefits. In using a dumbbell you have more activation of the anterior (front) deltoid than when using a barbell. You can also identify whether you have an imbalance in your shoulder strength. When performing it standing you will be challenging your core muscles to stabilize you during the press. In daily life, you may need to place objects on shelves above your head (or your luggage in the overhead compartment on a plane) and this exercise will build strength to do it safely.';

const kBentOverRows =
    'Name: Bent Over Row.\n\nSteps:\n\n1: Holding a barbell with a pronated grip (palms facing down), bend your knees slightly and bring your torso forward, by bending at the waist, while keeping the back straight until it is almost parallel to the floor.\n2: Now, while keeping the torso stationary, breathe out and lift the barbell to you. Keep the elbows close to the body and only use the forearms to hold the weight. At the top contracted position, squeeze the back muscles and hold for a brief pause.\n3: Then inhale and slowly lower the barbell back to the starting position.\n4: Repeat.\n\nBenefits: The bent-over row (and any back exercises, for that matter) are important to incorporate into your strength routine to maintain the balance of strength between the back and front of your body. The bent-over row is the perfect complement to the bench press because it targets the muscles on the opposite side of your body.';

const kPushUps =
    'Name: Push Ups.\n\nSteps:\n\n1: Get down on your fours, Place your hands firmly on the ground, directly under your shoulders. Pressing your toes into the floor to stabilize your lower half.

They can be performed anywhere with no equipment needed and can be performed by people of all abilities. If performed correctly and regularly crunches can help to improve your balance.';

const kToeTouches =
    'Name: Toe Touches.\n\nSteps\n\n1: To begin, lie down on the floor or an exercise mat with your back pressed against the floor. Your arms should be lying across your sides with the palms facing down.\n2: Your legs should be touching each other. Slowly elevate your legs up in the air until they are almost perpendicular to the floor with a slight bend at the knees.

If you want to add more intensity, go faster, use a bigger range of motion for the exercises, add impact, or use a heavier resistance.\n5: Do one circuit for a short, 15-minute workout or repeat the circuit as many times as you like.\n6: End with a cool down and be sure to stretch the lower body.\n\nBenefits: A dynamic stretching routine is meant to prepare your body for physical activity by increasing blood flow and temperature to your working tissues. The deep knee bend targets your glutes, quadriceps and calves. These muscles work together when you squat, jump and run, so athletes in a variety of sports commonly incorporate them into their dynamic warm-ups. The deep knee bend forces your glutes, quads and calves to contract, which increases blood flow to those muscles. As you lower down into the knee bend, your glutes, quads and calves eccentrically contract, which means they lengthen as they contract, which helps reduce the risk of strains.';

const kHeelTouches =
    'Name: Heel Touches.\n\nSteps\n\n1: Lay down on your back on the exercising floor with your knees bent. Place your feet flat and widen then slightly more than your shoulder-apart-width.\n2: Starting position: Extend your arms towards the downward direction by the side of the body with your palms facing inwards.\n3: While exhaling your breath, crunch your abs in the forward right direction.

const kScissorKicks =
    'Name: Scissor Kicks.\n\nSteps\n\n1: To begin, lie down with your back pressed against the floor or on an exercise mat (optional). Your arms should be fully extended to the sides with your palms facing down.

const kStraightLegKickback =
    'Name: Straight Leg KickBacks.\n\nSteps\n\n1: The original posture remains the same in almost all donkey kick variants. Down on all fours.\n2: Keep the knees together and lower your upper body further by bending your elbows and keeping the forearm straight on the floor.\n3: Straighten your right leg and lift it as much as you can.\n4: Do not bend the knees or move the hips.\n5: Bring down the leg and repeat with the other leg.\n6: Repeat.\n\nBenefits: Leg kickbacks mimic movements you may make every day. Standing on one foot and extending one leg behind you is the same movement as a kickback. This puts your hip into extension — the opposite of flexion, when you kick your leg out in front of you. Extension is one of the primary movements your glutes — especially the gluteus maximus — are responsible for. Whether you want a better-looking butt or you want to get your glute muscles firing properlyfor running, cross-country skiing or any other sports where proper hip extension is crucial, kickbacks are an excellent training tool.';

const kStandingHamstringCurls =
    'Name: Standing Hamstring Curls\n\nSteps\n\n1: Start by lying flat on your stomach.\n2: Adjust the roller pad so that it rests comfortably on the back of your ankles, just above the heels. Check to make sure the pads aren\'t too high upon your calves as this can place pressure on your Achilles tendon and reduce your range of motion.\n3: Inhale and lightly grasp the support handles on each side of the machine.\n4: Lift your feet smoothly as you exhale, keeping your hips firmly on the bench.\n5: Inhale as you flex your knee and pull your ankles as close to your buttocks as you can.\n6: Hold this position for a beat, allowing yourself to make sure you are focused as you prepare to lower your legs.\n7: Inhale fully as you return your feet to starting position in a smooth, slow, controlled movement.\n8: Repeat.\n\nBenefits: While the primary benefits of leg curls are strengthening and improving flexibility in your hamstrings, the exercise also targets other muscle groups. Having strong, flexible hamstrings is an important factor in your overall strength, balance, and stamina. Hamstrings that can withstand the demands of your workout are not just helpful, being strong here will also help you avoid injury as you go about your day to day life. Good posture and balance protect your muscles as you do everything from play with your kids to household chores.
